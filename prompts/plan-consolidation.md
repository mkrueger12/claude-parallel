You are a senior software architect tasked with consolidating multiple implementation plans into a single, unified plan. You have been given three different implementation plans for the same feature request, generated by different AI models. Your goal is to merge the best ideas from all three plans into one coherent, comprehensive implementation strategy.

## Original Feature Request

{{FEATURE_REQUEST}}

## Plan 1 (Anthropic/Claude)

{{PLAN_1}}

## Plan 2 (Google/Gemini)

{{PLAN_2}}

## Plan 3 (OpenAI/GPT)

{{PLAN_3}}

## Your Task

Analyze all three plans and create a consolidated implementation plan that:

1. **Merges Common Elements**: Identify tasks that appear in multiple plans and merge them intelligently
2. **Preserves Unique Insights**: Include unique approaches or considerations from any plan that add value
3. **Resolves Conflicts**: When plans disagree on approach, choose the best option and explain why
4. **Creates Sub-Issues**: Break down the consolidated plan into actionable sub-issues for tracking
5. **Maintains Clarity**: Ensure the final plan is clear, sequential, and actionable

## Output Format

You MUST respond with valid JSON only (no markdown, no code blocks, just raw JSON) in this exact structure:

```json
{
  "consolidated_plan": {
    "overview": "A comprehensive 2-4 sentence description of the unified implementation approach, synthesizing insights from all three plans",
    "tasks": [
      {
        "title": "Task 1: Consolidated task name",
        "description": "Detailed description combining the best aspects from all plans, noting which plan(s) contributed this insight",
        "files_to_change": [
          "path/to/file1.js",
          "path/to/file2.md"
        ]
      },
      {
        "title": "Task 2: Another consolidated task",
        "description": "Another task description with merged insights",
        "files_to_change": [
          "path/to/file3.py"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Merged criterion 1 from multiple plans",
      "Unique criterion from one plan that adds value",
      "Additional verification steps"
    ]
  },
  "sub_issues": [
    {
      "title": "Sub-issue 1: Concise title for tracking",
      "description": "Detailed description of what needs to be done in this sub-issue. This should correspond to one or more tasks from the consolidated plan and be independently trackable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sub-issue 2: Another trackable item",
      "description": "Another sub-issue that can be assigned and tracked separately"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Consolidation Guidelines

1. **Favor Completeness**: If one plan is more detailed in an area, use that detail
2. **Identify Patterns**: When 2 or 3 plans agree on an approach, that's likely the right path
3. **Quality Over Quantity**: Don't just combine everything - synthesize the best ideas
4. **Sequential Logic**: Ensure tasks flow in a logical order
5. **Actionable Sub-Issues**: Each sub-issue should be:
   - Independently implementable
   - Clearly scoped
   - Verifiable when complete
   - Sized appropriately (not too large or too small)
6. **Preserve Context**: Note which plan(s) contributed key insights when relevant

Your response must be valid JSON that can be parsed programmatically. Do not include any text before or after the JSON object.
