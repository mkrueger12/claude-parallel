Session 19: Task 1 - Create setup-opencode-environment composite action

Completed:
- Created .github/actions/setup-opencode-environment/action.yml
- Composite action consolidates 4-step OpenCode environment setup
- Includes all required steps:
  1. Setup Bun (using oven-sh/setup-bun@v1)
  2. Install OpenCode CLI globally (bun install -g opencode-ai@latest)
  3. Install project dependencies (bun install)
  4. Install ast-grep and trust it (conditional)
- Defined 3 optional inputs with sensible defaults:
  - bun-version (default: 'latest')
  - install-ast-grep (default: 'true')
  - working-directory (default: '.')
- Added output for bun-version
- Follows existing composite action patterns
- All verification steps pass
- Updated features.json: marked test #1 as passing

Verification performed:
- File exists at .github/actions/setup-opencode-environment/action.yml
- Is valid composite action structure (using: 'composite')
- Includes all 4 required setup steps
- Has proper inputs with defaults
- Matches patterns from existing actions (setup-claude, setup-opencode)

Next steps:
- Task 2: Create setup-runtime-and-deps composite action
- Task 3: Create run-build-checks composite action
- Task 4: Refactor multi-provider-plan-v2.yml to use new action

Current status: 1/10 tests passing

Session 20: Task 2 - Create setup-runtime-and-deps composite action

Completed:
- Created .github/actions/setup-runtime-and-deps/action.yml
- Composite action consolidates runtime setup and dependency installation
- Accepts required inputs:
  - runtime (js, python, go, rust)
  - package_manager (bun, npm, yarn, pnpm, pip, poetry, go, cargo)
- Accepts optional inputs with defaults:
  - node-version (default: '20')
  - python-version (default: '3.11')
  - go-version (default: '1.21')
  - working-directory (default: '.')
- Conditional runtime setup:
  - JS: Setup Bun (if bun) or Node.js (if npm/yarn/pnpm)
  - Python: Setup Python with specified version
  - Go: Setup Go with specified version
  - Rust: Setup Rust toolchain
- Dependency installation handles all package managers:
  - JS: bun install, npm install, yarn install, pnpm install
  - Python: pip install, poetry install
  - Go: go mod download
  - Rust: cargo fetch
- Consolidates ~65 lines of runtime setup + ~35 lines of install dependencies
- Matches original workflow logic exactly
- Updated features.json: marked test #2 as passing

Verification performed:
- File exists at .github/actions/setup-runtime-and-deps/action.yml
- Is valid YAML (validated with Node.js)
- Uses composite action structure (using: 'composite')
- Accepts runtime and package_manager inputs (both required)
- Handles all 4 runtime types (js, python, go, rust)
- Includes dependency installation for each runtime
- Logic matches reusable-implement-issue.yml lines 136-196

Next steps:
- Task 3: Create run-build-checks composite action
- Task 4: Refactor multi-provider-plan-v2.yml to use new action
- Task 5: Refactor reusable-implement-issue.yml to use new composite actions

Current status: 2/10 tests passing
