Session 19: Task 1 - Create setup-opencode-environment composite action

Completed:
- Created .github/actions/setup-opencode-environment/action.yml
- Composite action consolidates 4-step OpenCode environment setup
- Includes all required steps:
  1. Setup Bun (using oven-sh/setup-bun@v1)
  2. Install OpenCode CLI globally (bun install -g opencode-ai@latest)
  3. Install project dependencies (bun install)
  4. Install ast-grep and trust it (conditional)
- Defined 3 optional inputs with sensible defaults:
  - bun-version (default: 'latest')
  - install-ast-grep (default: 'true')
  - working-directory (default: '.')
- Added output for bun-version
- Follows existing composite action patterns
- All verification steps pass
- Updated features.json: marked test #1 as passing

Verification performed:
- File exists at .github/actions/setup-opencode-environment/action.yml
- Is valid composite action structure (using: 'composite')
- Includes all 4 required setup steps
- Has proper inputs with defaults
- Matches patterns from existing actions (setup-claude, setup-opencode)

Next steps:
- Task 2: Create setup-runtime-and-deps composite action
- Task 3: Create run-build-checks composite action
- Task 4: Refactor multi-provider-plan-v2.yml to use new action

Current status: 1/10 tests passing
