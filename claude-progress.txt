**Date:** 2025-12-20
**Status:** COMPLETED ✓

## Previous Session: Task 4 (DEL-1311) - Implement Installer CLI

**Date:** 2025-12-20
**Status:** COMPLETED ✓

## Previous Session: Task 3 (DEL-1310) - Bundle Scripts for Workflows

**Date:** 2025-12-20
**Status:** COMPLETED ✓

### Task Completed

Task 4: Implement installer CLI (DEL-1311)
- Created CLI entry point (src/cli/index.ts)
- Implemented main install logic (src/cli/install.ts)
- Implemented manifest read/write and hashing (src/cli/manifest.ts)
- Updated package.json with bin field and files array
- All 5 Task 4 tests passing

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Created Manifest Management Module** (`src/cli/manifest.ts`)
   - SHA256 hash calculation for file contents
   - Read/write manifest JSON file
   - Detect user modifications by comparing hashes
   - Manifest structure tracks version, install time, and file hashes

2. **Implemented Install Logic** (`src/cli/install.ts`)
   - Finds templates directory relative to installed package location
   - Maps template files to destination paths (workflows → .github/workflows/, etc.)
   - Plans file actions (install/skip-modified/overwrite)
   - Executes file actions with directory creation
   - Preserves executable permissions
   - Supports --force, --dry-run, --yes flags
   - Updates manifest after installation

3. **Created CLI Entry Point** (`src/cli/index.ts`)
   - Argument parsing for --help, --yes, --force, --dry-run
   - Comprehensive help text with usage examples
   - Error handling with proper exit codes
   - Shebang for npx execution

4. **Updated Package Configuration**
   - Changed package name to `install-claude-parallel`
   - Added bin field pointing to `dist/cli/index.js`
   - Added files array including `dist/` and `templates/`
   - Added publishConfig for public npm access

5. **Thorough Testing**
   - Tested --help flag shows usage information
   - Tested --dry-run shows changes without modifying files
   - Tested full installation creates all 16 files correctly
   - Tested conflict detection when user modifies files
   - Tested --force flag overwrites user modifications
   - All tests verified in /tmp/test-install directory

6. **Updated features.json**
   - task-4-cli-entry-point: passes = true
   - task-4-installer-creates-files: passes = true
   - task-4-manifest-conflict-detection: passes = true
   - task-4-dry-run-mode: passes = true
   - task-4-help-flag: passes = true

### Technical Details

**CLI Architecture:**
- Three-module design: index.ts (CLI) → install.ts (logic) → manifest.ts (hashing)
- Uses Node.js built-in crypto for SHA256 hashing
- Template path mapping logic handles all file types
- Manifest stored at `.github/claude-parallel/.install-manifest.json`

**Conflict Detection Logic:**
1. Read existing manifest (if present)
2. Calculate hash of destination file (if exists)
3. Compare with manifest hash
4. If different → file was modified by user → skip (unless --force)
5. If same → update to new version
6. If no manifest entry → treat as new file

**File Action Planning:**
- Separates planning from execution for dry-run support
- Actions: install, skip-modified, skip-exists, overwrite
- Creates parent directories recursively as needed
- Preserves executable permissions using chmodSync

**Package Distribution:**
- Uses `dist/` for compiled JavaScript
- Uses `templates/` for files to be copied
- Package name: `install-claude-parallel` (for npx)
- Bin entry makes it executable with `npx install-claude-parallel`

### Files Created/Modified

**New Files:**
- `src/cli/manifest.ts` - Manifest read/write and SHA256 hashing
- `src/cli/install.ts` - Main installation logic
- `src/cli/index.ts` - CLI entry point with argument parsing

**Modified Files:**
- `package.json` - Changed name, added bin field, added files array, added publishConfig
- `src/agents/planning-agent.ts` - Removed unused __dirname variable
- `src/agents/linear-agent.ts` - Removed unused __dirname variable
- `features.json` - Marked all 5 Task 4 tests as passing
- `claude-progress.txt` - This file

### Next Steps

The next session should implement Task 5 (DEL-1312): Documentation & release preparation.

This involves:
1. Update README.md with installer usage section
2. Create docs/installer.md with detailed documentation

4. Verify npm pack includes correct files
5. Test installation in a real-world repository

### Notes

**CLI Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Show help
npx install-claude-parallel --help

# Install with prompts
npx install-claude-parallel

# Install without prompts
npx install-claude-parallel --yes

# Preview changes
npx install-claude-parallel --dry-run

# Force overwrite
npx install-claude-parallel --force
```

**What Gets Installed:**
- 2 workflow files in `.github/workflows/`
- 4 script files in `.github/claude-parallel/scripts/`
- 5 prompt files in `.github/claude-parallel/prompts/`
- 4 agent files in `.claude/agents/`
- 1 .env.example file at root
- 1 manifest file at `.github/claude-parallel/.install-manifest.json`

The installer is fully functional and ready for npm publishing. It intelligently handles updates by detecting user modifications and preserving them unless explicitly overridden with --force.
