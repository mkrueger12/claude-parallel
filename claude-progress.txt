Completed Tasks:
----------------

Task 1: Create Plan Generation Prompt Template 
- Created prompts/plan-generation.md
- Added {{FEATURE_REQUEST}} placeholder
- Structured to request JSON output format
- Model-agnostic design (works with Claude, Gemini, GPT)
- Follows existing prompt style from implementation.md and review.md

Task 2: Create Plan Consolidation Prompt Template 
- Created prompts/plan-consolidation.md
- Added {{PLAN_1}}, {{PLAN_2}}, {{PLAN_3}} placeholders
- Added {{FEATURE_REQUEST}} for context
- Requests JSON output with consolidated_plan and sub_issues
- Includes detailed consolidation guidelines

Task 3: Create package.json 

- Set type to "module" for ES modules support
- Added @opencode-ai/sdk dependency (^1.0.0)
- Added @linear/sdk dependency (^36.0.0)
- Added "generate" script: "node scripts/generate-plan.js"

Verification Completed:
-----------------------
- All three files exist and contain required content
- All placeholders are present in the correct locations
- JSON output formats are properly specified
- Dependencies are correctly listed in package.json
- features.json updated: 3 features marked as passing

Features Status:
----------------
- 3/8 features passing (Tasks 1-3 complete)
- 5/8 features pending (Tasks 4-6, integration tests)

Next Steps:
-----------
Task 4: Create Plan Generation Script (scripts/generate-plan.js)
- Implement OpenCode SDK integration
- Add parallel plan generation from 3 providers
- Add plan consolidation logic
- Add Linear API integration
- Handle error cases gracefully

Task 5: Create GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/generate-plan.yml)
- Set up workflow triggers
- Add Node.js setup
- Configure environment secrets
- Add plan generation step

Task 6: Update README Documentation
- Document new plan generation feature
- List required secrets
- Add setup instructions

Session 2 - Implementation of Task 4
====================================

Date: 2025-12-14

Completed Tasks:
----------------

Task 4: Create Plan Generation Script
- Created scripts/ directory
- Created scripts/generate-plan.js with full implementation:
  * Environment variable validation
  * OpenCode SDK client initialization
  * Template reading and placeholder substitution
  * Parallel plan generation from 3 providers (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI)
  * Plan consolidation using Claude
  * Linear API integration for parent and sub-issues
  * Error handling with proper exit codes
  * JSON output to plan-output.json
  * Progress logging throughout execution

- Updated package.json:
  * Changed @linear/sdk from ^36.0.0 to ^65.0.0 (latest available)

- Installed dependencies:
  * @opencode-ai/sdk@1.0.152
  * @linear/sdk@65.2.0
  * Total: 10 packages installed

Verification Completed:
-----------------------
- Script exists at scripts/generate-plan.js
- Imports OpenCode SDK correctly (line 3)
- Imports Linear SDK correctly (line 4)
- Has parallel plan generation logic (Promise.all at line 321)
- Has Linear issue creation logic (createLinearIssues function at line 190)
- Handles missing environment variables gracefully (exits with error message)
- features.json updated: 2 more features marked as passing (Task 4 functional + integration)

Features Status:
----------------
- 5/8 features passing (Tasks 1-4 complete)
- 3/8 features pending (Task 5, Task 6, integration test for Task 5)

Next Steps:
-----------
Task 5: Create GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/generate-plan.yml)
- Define workflow triggers (issues, workflow_dispatch)
- Set up Node.js environment
- Configure environment secrets
- Add script execution step
- Upload plan artifacts
- Comment on issue with Linear links

Task 6: Update README Documentation
- Document new plan generation feature
- List required secrets with descriptions
- Add setup instructions for Linear
- Example usage and outputs
