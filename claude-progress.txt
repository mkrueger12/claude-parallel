# Claude Progress Notes

## Session 1 - December 4, 2025

### What I Accomplished
- Completed Tasks 1-4 from plan.md
- Task 1: Project Setup - Created package.json, tsconfig.json, .gitignore
- Task 2: Configuration and Types - Created src/config.ts and src/types.ts
- Task 3: GitHub Service - Implemented parseIssueUrl() and fetchIssueDetails()
- Task 4: Repository Service - Implemented cloneRepository(), cleanupRepository(), ensureWorkDir()

### Verification
- npm install: SUCCESS (11 packages, 0 vulnerabilities)
- TypeScript compilation: SUCCESS (npx tsc --noEmit passes with strict mode)
- All services properly typed with ESM imports

### Current Completion Status
0/12 tests passing (no tests run yet - implementation phase)

### Next Steps
The following tasks from plan.md still need to be implemented:
- Task 5: Job Service - Create service to manage job execution
- Task 6: API Routes - Health Endpoint
- Task 7: API Routes - Jobs Endpoint
- Task 8: Main Entry Point - Wire everything together

Once Tasks 5-8 are complete, we can start testing the endpoints and marking tests as passing in features.json.

### Notes
- All code uses ESM syntax (import/export)
- TypeScript configured with strict mode enabled
- Using Hono v4.10.0 for HTTP framework
- Configuration supports environment variables with sensible defaults
