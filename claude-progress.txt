## Session Progress - 2026-01-04

### Completed Work

**Task 1: Update OpencodeClient Interface and Add auth.set() Types**
- Status:  COMPLETE
- File modified: src/lib/opencode.ts
- Changes:
  * Added imports for SDK's OpencodeClient type from @opencode-ai/sdk
  * Defined AuthData discriminated union types (AuthOAuth, AuthApiKey, AuthWellKnown)
  * Created AuthSetOptions interface for client.auth.set() calls
  * Simplified OpencodeClient to use SDK type directly (type alias instead of interface)
  * Removed custom EventProperties, ToolPart, SessionStatus types (no longer needed)
- Verification:
  * bun run type-check: PASSED (no TypeScript errors)
  * biome formatting: PASSED
  * Git commit: bf04b68
  * features.json: Test #1 marked as passing

### Type Definitions Added

The following auth types were added to match the OpenCode SDK's structure:

1. **AuthOAuth**: OAuth credentials with access, refresh, expires, enterpriseUrl
2. **AuthApiKey**: API key auth with type="api" and key field
3. **AuthWellKnown**: Well-known auth with key and token fields
4. **AuthData**: Union type of all three auth types
5. **AuthSetOptions**: Options interface for client.auth.set() calls

### Key Discoveries

- The SDK uses type="api" not "api_key" for API key authentication
- The SDK's OpencodeClient already has the auth.set() method built-in
- By using the SDK's type directly, we inherit all methods including auth
- EventProperties and related types were custom types that are no longer needed

**Task 2: Remove apiKey from OpencodeServerOptions and Provider Config**
- Status: COMPLETE
- File modified: src/lib/opencode.ts
- Changes:
  * Made apiKey optional in OpencodeServerOptions interface (line 61: `apiKey?: string`)
  * Removed apiKey from provider config construction (lines 118-124)
  * Provider config now only contains `timeout: false`
  * Removed apiKey from function destructuring since it's no longer used
- Verification:
  * bun run type-check: PASSED (no TypeScript errors)
  * biome formatting: PASSED
  * Git commit: 5d6dd96
  * features.json: Test #2 marked as passing

**Task 3: Create setupAuthentication Function**
- Status: COMPLETE
- File modified: src/lib/opencode.ts
- Changes:
  * Added exported async function setupAuthentication()
  * Implements client.auth.set() call with proper error handling
  * Supports OAuth token authentication for Anthropic (CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN)
  * Supports API key authentication for all providers
  * Includes fallback logic to environment variables
  * Added helper function getApiKeyFromEnv() to check environment variables
  * Throws descriptive error when no credentials found
- Authentication flow:
  1. First checks for CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN for Anthropic provider
  2. Falls back to explicit apiKey parameter if provided
  3. Falls back to environment variables (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
  4. Throws error if no credentials found
- Verification:
  * bun run type-check: PASSED (no TypeScript errors)
  * biome formatting: PASSED
  * Git commit: 4651612
  * features.json: Test #3 marked as passing

**Task 4: Integrate setupAuthentication into createOpencodeServer**
- Status: COMPLETE
- File modified: src/lib/opencode.ts
- Changes:
  * Re-added apiKey to options destructuring in createOpencodeServer()
  * Added call to setupAuthentication() after server creation (line 251)
  * The function now properly sets up authentication via client.auth.set()
  * apiKey is passed as optional fallback parameter
- Flow:
  1. Extract options including optional apiKey
  2. Build config WITHOUT apiKey in provider options
  3. Create server with createOpencode()
  4. Call setupAuthentication(client, provider, apiKey)
  5. Return client and server
- Verification:
  * bun run type-check: PASSED (no TypeScript errors)
  * bun run build: PASSED (compilation successful)
  * biome formatting: PASSED
  * Git commit: 74f62d1
  * features.json: Test #4 marked as passing

### Next Steps

**Task 5: Update agent-runner.ts to Use New Auth Flow**
- Wrap getApiKey in try-catch for optional behavior
- Pass apiKey as optional fallback to createOpencodeServer

**Task 6: Update types.ts ProviderConfig Interface**
- Mark apiKey as optional in ProviderConfig

**Task 7: Build and Verify**
- Run full build and verify all changes work together

### Current Status

Tests passing: 4/8 (50%)
Current file state: Clean working directory after commit 74f62d1

Tasks 1-4 are complete. The createOpencodeServer function now properly
calls setupAuthentication after server creation, enabling server-inherited
credentials with fallback to explicit API keys.
